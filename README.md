# Time_Series_Anomaly_Detection
The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end machine learning solution that detects anomalies in time-series sensor data collected from industrial equipment. The focus is on identifying unusual sensor patterns that deviate from normal operating behavior without relying on labeled anomaly data.
